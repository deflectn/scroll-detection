# scroll-detection
balanced natural onscroll triggering for slide mechanics

## Motivation

Most popular wheelevent detection methods/scripts use some kind of hacking or non user focused practices. I wanted to try a more natural way of detection. A way that response to the users expectation. [Try](https://deflectn.github.io/scroll-detection) it for yourself and feel free to judge my approach, but please tell me.

## Usage
(integrateable script follow)

## TODO
- [ ] refining trigger
- [ ] check balancing

## TODO for release
